# These are some of my ideas for a comic book marketplace I hope to someday create. I'd like to start with a dynamic web application and then create a react mobile, SPA. Lots of work to do. 

### **1. Creator-Owned Spotlight**  
- **Feature:** Provide a platform where creators retain 100% ownership of their work and get the majority share of profits.  
- **Unique Selling Point:** A "Featured Creator of the Month" section highlights a new indie creator, including interviews, artwork previews, and crowdfunding links.

### **2. Customizable Comic Subscriptions**  
- **Feature:** Readers can subscribe to specific creators or genres and receive curated indie comics on a monthly or quarterly basis.  
- **Unique Selling Point:** Include exclusive behind-the-scenes content, like sketches, scripts, or early-access issues.

### **3. Indie Comic Collaborations Hub**  
- **Feature:** Connect writers, artists, colorists, and letterers to collaborate on new projects directly within the marketplace.  
- **Unique Selling Point:** Offer project management tools like task boards and revenue-sharing agreements for creators.

### **4. Augmented Reality (AR) Integration**  
- **Feature:** Introduce AR comics where readers can scan pages with their phones to reveal hidden content, animations, or creator commentaries.  
- **Unique Selling Point:** Partner with indie creators to produce AR-enhanced comic books, making the experience interactive.

### **5. Pay-What-You-Want Model**  
- **Feature:** Allow readers to pay what they feel is fair for certain indie comics, with a suggested price as a baseline.  
- **Unique Selling Point:** Introduce a leaderboard showing the most generous readers, encouraging community engagement.

### **6. Personalized Recommendations Using AI**  
- **Feature:** Use machine learning to suggest indie comics based on a readerâ€™s interests, reading history, and reviews.  
- **Unique Selling Point:** Pair this with personalized notes from the creators, enhancing the indie experience.

### **7. NFT-Enabled Comic Ownership**  
- **Feature:** Allow creators to sell limited digital editions of their comics as NFTs, giving buyers verifiable ownership and perks like access to special events or physical merchandise.  
- **Unique Selling Point:** Focus exclusively on eco-friendly blockchain options to appeal to environmentally-conscious creators and readers.

### **8. Community Voting and Crowdfunding**  
- **Feature:** Let users vote on comic ideas pitched by creators. The most popular concepts get crowdfunded within the platform.  
- **Unique Selling Point:** Include progress tracking so readers can follow the development of their supported projects.

### **9. Indie Comic Book Clubs**  
- **Feature:** Create virtual or local indie comic book clubs where users can discuss their favorite comics, attend live Q&A sessions with creators, or participate in exclusive giveaways.  
- **Unique Selling Point:** Integrate book club-specific discounts on featured comics.

### **10. Focus on Diverse Voices**  
- **Feature:** Dedicate sections of the marketplace to amplify underrepresented voices in the comic world, such as BIPOC, LGBTQ+, and international creators.  
- **Unique Selling Point:** Partner with organizations or grant programs that support these creators to offer funding or visibility boosts.
